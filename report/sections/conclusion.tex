The project's aim to design a control system for hovering quadcopter was not reached. Nevertheless, the essential parts of the system were covered. The electrical components used in the prototype were identified and their functionality was explained. The motor performance was tested in various scenarios and an approximation of their functionality around the hovering point was estimated.
Accelerometer, gyroscope and ultrasonic sensors were tested out and working in simulated flight scenarios.
Various data and coefficients for both electronic components and the whole prototype were gathered.
Finally, the flight dynamics of a quadcopter were identified and related to the rest of the system. A Simulink model was designed in an attempt to simulate the system's performance.
However, the test accuracy was never fully measured on a working prototype, since the designed control system was never implemented on the vehicle. Given the complexity of a quadcopter system and the short working period, there was not enough time to attempt the implementation of the control system, so the real performance of the prototype remains unknown.
The final conclusion would be that although all parts of the system are thought to be working properly in theoretical scenarios, a fully functioning prototype was never created.
